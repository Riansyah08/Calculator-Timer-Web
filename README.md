# üïí Switchable Calculator & Timer
A simple, visually appealing web application that allows users to switch between a Calculator and a Timer in one interface. Designed with an intuitive UI and responsive layout, this project demonstrates interactive DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript, with no external frameworks.   
This project was developed as a Capstone Project for the IBM X Hacktiv8 Student Developer Initiative Program, specifically under the Code Generation and Optimization with IBM Granite course.

### ü§ñ AI Support Explanation
This project does not include any AI functionality within its code. However, AI tools (IBM Granite) were used during development to:
- Generate clean, optimized JavaScript logic for timer and calculator operations
- Improve code readability and structure
- Suggest responsive CSS design and animations
- Validate cross-browser compatibility best practices
    
There is no AI running within the app itself ‚Äî it is fully client-side, static HTML/CSS/JS.
