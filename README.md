### 🤖 AI Support Explanation
This project does not include any AI functionality within its code. However, AI tools (such as ChatGPT) were used during development to:

Generate clean, optimized JavaScript logic for timer and calculator operations

Improve code readability and structure

Suggest responsive CSS design and animations

Validate cross-browser compatibility best practices

There is no AI running within the app itself — it is fully client-side, static HTML/CSS/JS.
